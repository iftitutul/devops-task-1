Write a bash script that takes a URL as input and prints the HTTP response code.
As an example, by running this:

 Bash: `./get-response.sh https://www.google.com`
 
 Python: `./get-response.sh https://www.google.com`

It will output something like this:

`Response code: 200`

If possible, the script should allow you to switch between following or not following redirects.
